<p>Hi there,</p>

<p> We are hoping to get your feedback on a project we recently started called The TR Prize, https://trprize.org. The basic idea is that the TR Prize provides peer reviews and funding based on the reviews for manuscripts submitted to preprint servers. We see the TR Prize as a way to incentivize preprints and open science, in general.</p>

<p>We saw your work on Biorxiv, so we thought we might gauge your interest in the idea. If youâ€™d like us to not include your work for consideration for reviews or funding just let us know. Any thoughts you might have would be greatly appreciated.
</p>
